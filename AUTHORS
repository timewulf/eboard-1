Refurbished Code Parts

The piece sets are based on Tim Mann's xboard pieceset
rendering (the 108x108 set) 

The algorithm used to scale piece bitmaps on the fly was
taken from Gimp 1.0.4 (http://www.gimp.org)

Translation Team

Starting with eboard 0.7.0, eboard has national language
support (NLS), Currently these languages have translations:

- Brazilian Portuguese (pt_BR), translation by Felipe Bergo
- German (de), translation by Bernhard Bialas
- Spanish (es), translation by Ricardo Mones Lastra
- French (fr), translation by Pierre Boulenguez and Simon Valiquette
- Italian (it_IT), translation by Massimo Danieli
- Czech (cs), translation by Ales Dolecek

To add another language, email me (Felipe), it's fairly
simple (for people familiar to eboard), takes some hours
and requires no programming skills.

If you find errors in the translations, please tell us!

note for 0.9.0: translations have not been updated since
0.8.0, so the new dialogs do not have translations yet,
I hope to release 0.9.1 soon with updated translations.
