 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Mon, 22 Jan 2007 20:00:05 -0800

eboard (1.0.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  
  * Correct the stupid mistake I made in setting $datadir and test outside
    the build directory this time (otherwise the program cleverly finds
    the data files in its source directory and starts just fine!).

  * In the words of upstream, there are "many bugfixes".  I will try to
    reverify old bugs as I have time, but bug submitters should feel
    free to close their bugs on their own if this release fixes them.

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Mon,  8 Jan 2007 10:37:57 -0800

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Mon, 24 May 2004 13:40:14 -0400

eboard (0.9.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release

  * Upstream dropped autotools for a less powerful homegrown configure;
    rewrote debian/rules to compensate.
  
  * NEWS vanished; remove it from debian/docs.

  * Remove beta warning from the control file -- this still isn't stable, but
    it isn't in the primitive state it was in when the warning was
    included.
  
  * Bump standards-version so lintian stops complaining.

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Sun, 23 May 2004 12:07:36 -0400

eboard (0.3.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * eboard needs sox to play sounds, and uses xfonts-75dpi as its default
  fonts package.  Added a Recommends for both (the fonts package because
  upstream asked for it; apparently he's gotten bug reports when it wasn't
  installed)

eboard (0.3.1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  of checking DATADIR.  Fixed.

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Tue,  7 Aug 2001 12:32:18 -0400

eboard (0.3.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * The list of themes is now generated from multiple files in
  /usr/share/games/eboard/eboard_themes.d.  This will hopefully allow
  multiple theme packages to be cleanly installed.  (yes, the program itself
  would preferably do this; this is just a hack for the time being while
  I wait for a proper solution)

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Tue,  7 Aug 2001 10:20:00 -0400

eboard (0.3.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Move eboard-config to /usr/bin, where it really belongs (this should be
  done in a cleaner way, but right now the rules file just moves it manually)

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Tue,  7 Aug 2001 09:56:51 -0400

eboard (0.3.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use /usr/share/games/eboard for datafiles instead of /usr/share/eboard.

  pkgdatadir, not $prefix/share/eboard; binaries go in bindir, not $prefix/bin
