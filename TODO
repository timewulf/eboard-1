eboard TODO
-----------

TODO and KNOWN BUGS:

- FICS recently introduced Thematic games which
  don't provide the initial moves, but rather
  an ECO code. You can play and watch those,
  but moving forward/backward, PGN saving
  and move list are still nuts.

- engine vs. engine mode

- show engine search (thinking)
  (you can get it on the console by typing "post" after
  the engine has been started)

- allow variants and takebacks in direct connection mode.

- support xboard protocol v1 engines (like phalanx)
