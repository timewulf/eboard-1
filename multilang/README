Hello, starting with eboard 0.9.5, the awfully bad-documented and
bloated GNU gettext has been dropped, in favor of an 80-line perl
script and 200 lines of C++ code (the source distribution of gettext
has several megabytes these days...I keep getting amazed on how GNU
manages to make things bloated).
