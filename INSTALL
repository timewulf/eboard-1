INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
==========================

from this directory, do

./configure
make
(become root)
make install

if ./configure won't work (maybe because your perl installation isn't
in /usr/bin), try 

perl ./configure

The configure script provides some command line options that control
how eboard is built and where it is installed, see './configure --help'.

By default, eboard is installed to /usr/local/bin , and its data
files are installed in /usr/local/share/eboard.
